# Automation Scripts for Day 2
### This repo contains scripts for crud operations related to different entities using v3 and v4 APIs. Feel free to use / contributing to this repo. I'll keep on updating any new use case that will come to me. Note: The Scripts requires some documentation and optimization to use right now, i'll soon standardize them and push in the main branch.

### V3 API Scripts
#### 1. Filter VMs on VM Names.
#### 2. Add to Categories using VM Names.
#### 3. Remove from Categories using VM Names.
#### 4. Fetch and Delete Orphan Recovery points : Deleted VMs / Migrated VMs / Existing VMs.
